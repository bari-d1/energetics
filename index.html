        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>On this site, you will find out all you need to know about Chemical Energetics.</p>
        <p>Chemical energetics is the study of chemical changes caused by energy.</p>
        <p>In Inorganic Chemistry you have learned that the material world is made up of some 90 natural occuring chemical elements, some more abundant than others. They combine with each other to make up compounds, mixtures, solutions, coloids, aggregates,
            and composite materials. The atoms are made up of tiny nuclei and are surrounded by electrons. The material world is constantly changing. The changes give rise to all sorts of phenomena, including light, thunder, floods, storms, and heat observed
            in the weather. Have you ever asked yourself what makes the material change? Well, former scientists have analyzed the question, and they have provided a simple answer to this. Energy causes all the changes.</p>
