        <p class="para">The general name for the enthalpy change for any reaction is the standard molar enthalpy(enthalpy per mole) change of reaction ΔH. It is measured in Kilojoules per mole, kJ/mol.</p>
        <h2 style='text-decoration: underline; text-align: left; margin-left: 50px;'>Standard enthalpies</h1>
            <p class="para">
                There are 2 types of standard enthalpies. Standard molar enthalpy of formation and Standard molar enthalpy of combustion.
                <br> <strong>The standard molar enthalpy of formation,</strong> Δ<sub>f</sub>H<sup>⦵</sup> is defined as the change in enthalpy when one mole of a substance in the standard state (1 atm of pressure and 298K) is formed from its pure elements
                under the same conditions.
                <br><strong>Standard enthalpy of combustion,</strong> Δ<sub>c</sub>H<sup>⦵</sup> is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of a substance burns under standard state conditions; it is sometimes called “heat of combustion.”

                <p class="para">There is no instrument used to measure enthalpy change instead, you make it such that the heat can be transferred into a particular mass of a substance, usually water.
                    <br> For this, you have to know three things:
                    <ol>
                        <li>The mass of the substance that is being heated up or cooled down</li>
                        <li>The temperature change that occurs</li>
                        <li>The specific heat capacity of the substance</li>
                    </ol>

                </p>
                <p class="para">The <strong>specific heat capacity</strong> of a subtance is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1g of the substance by 1K. It is measured in joules per gram per kelvin, J g<sup>-1</sup>K<sup>-1</sup></p>

                <h3 class="para"><strong>Example 1</strong></h3>
                <p class="para">A solution was made by dissolving a spatula of potassium nitrate into 50cm<sup>3</sup> of water. The temperature changed from 20.4˚C to 18.7˚C. Calculate the enthalpy change for this reaction.</p>
                <h4 class="para">Solution</h4>
                <p class="para">To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) we must know the values for c, m and ΔT. The specific heat capacity (c) is a constant, with a value of 4.18. Since 50cm<sup>3</sup> of water have been used, the mass of water (m) is 0.05 kg. <br><br>From
                    the question we can see that the temperature has decreased by 1.7 ˚C. This means that the reaction is endothermic (so ΔH will be positive).
                    <br><br> ΔH=cmΔT = 4.18 x 0.05 x 1.7 = 0.3553 kJ</p>
