        <p class="para">The standard enthalpy change of combustion of a compound is the enthalpy change which occurs when one mole of the compound is burned completely in oxygen under standard conditions, and with everything in its standard state.
            <br>The enthalpy change of combustion will always have a negative value(exothermic), of course, because burning always releases heat.
        </p>
        <p class="para">Notice:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Enthalpy of combustion equations will often contain fractions, because you must start with only 1 mole of whatever you are burning.</li>
                <li>If you are talking about standard enthalpy changes of combustion, everything must be in its standard state. One important result of this is that any water you write amongst the products must be there as liquid water.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="para">Enthalpies of combustion can be used to compare which fuels or substances release the most energy when they are burned. They can be calculated using a bomb calorimeter.</p>
        <p class="para">A simplified version of this experiment can be carried out in a lab using a spirit burner and a metal can as shown below.
        </p>

        <p class="para">To carry out this experiment, you will need to measure the following:
            <ul>
                <li>the starting temperature of the water</li>
                <li>the final temperature of the water</li>
                <li>the mass of the burner before the experiment</li>
                <li>the temperature change</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="para"> Firstly, the fuel is burnt and the temperature increase is measured, we can now use the mass of the fuel corresponding to the temperaature increase to calculate the enthalpy of combustion of that fuel</p>
        <h2 style='text-decoration: underline;'> Calculating the enthalpy change of combustion</h2>
        <h3 class="para"><strong>Example</strong></h3>
        <p class="para">Ethanol (C2H5OH) was placed in a spirit burner and used to heat 200 cm<sup>3</sup> of water in a copper can. When the temperature of the water had increased by 5˚C, the mass of the burner and ethanol had decreased by 0.36 g. Calculate the enthalpy
            of combustion of ethanol.</p>
        <h3 class="para"><strong> Solution</strong></h3>
        <p class="para">Firstly, we know that 0.36 g of ethanol burned, so we can convert this into a number of moles. <br><br>
            <img class="formula" src="https://bam.files.bbci.co.uk/bam/live/content/zt9tvcw/small" alt="enthalpy calculation">
            <br><br> Secondly, we can use <i>ΔH=cmΔT</i> to calculate the enthalpy change in the experiment described in the question (ie when 0.008 moles of ethanol is burned).
            <br><br><i>ΔH=cmΔT</i> = 4.18 x 0.2 x 5
            <br><br> = 4.18 kJ
            <br><br> Lastly, we can use the enthalpy change for the experiment in the question to calculate the enthalpy of combustion (ie when one mole of ethanol is burned).
            <br><br> 0.008 moles of ethanol = 4.18kJ
            <br><br> 1 mole of ethanol = 1/0.008 x 4.18
            <br><br> = -522.5 kJmol<sup>-1</sup>
