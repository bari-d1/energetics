            <h1>Exothermic Reactions</h1>
            <p>An exothermic reaction is any reaction that produces heat.
                <br> When a chemical reaction takes place, chemical bonds break and new ones are formed.
                <br>The overall change may result in energy being given out.
                <br> At the end of the reaction, if energy has been given out, the reaction is said to be an exothermic reaction.
                <br> Neutralising an acid with an alkali is an example of an exothermic reaction.
                <br>It is always the case that a reaction is exothermic in one direction and endothermic in another.</p>
            <p>In an exothermic reaction, energy is released because the total energy of the products is less than the total energy of the reactants. For this reason, the change in enthalpy for an exothermic reaction will always be negative.<br></p>
        </div>
        <div class="endo">
            <h1>Endothermic Reactions</h1>
            <p>An endothermic reaction is any reaction which requires or absorbs energy from its surroundings, usually in the form of heat.
                <br> The breakdown of limestone (calcium carbonate) to lime (calcium oxide) and carbon dioxide is an example of an endothermic reaction.
            </p>
            <p>When heat energy is absorbed from the surroundings,the system is heated to provide the heat energy and a high enough temperature to promote the reaction.
                <br>This means the products store more energy than the reactants and the surroundings have less energy.
            </p>
            <p>Endothermic reactions yield products that are higher in energy than the reactants. As such, the change in enthalpy for an endothermic reaction is always positive.</p>

            <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">Why is it important to know about energy changes in chemical reactions?</h1>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To know how much energy fuels release on combustion in order to find the best way to acheive carbon-neutrality.</li>
                    <li>To know how much energy is released from burning fossil fuels so comparisons can be made with alternative fuels like hydrogen or bio fuels in order to know which fuel will be more productive.</li>
                    <li>The same sort of data is important in knowing how much energy is released in metabolising foods such as fats and carbohydrates.</li>
                    <li>To know how much energy is needed for a reaction to take place</li>
                </ul>
