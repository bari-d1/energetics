        <h1>Enthalpy</h1>
        <p class="para">There are conditions that affect the amount of heat given out or absorbed from the environment in a chemical reaction. <br> These include but are not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>Temperature</li>
                <li>Pressure</li>
                <li>Concentration of solutions</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="para"><strong>Enthalpy</strong> is a thermodynamic property of a system. It is the sum of the internal energy added to the product of the pressure and volume of the system. It reflects the capacity of the system to release heat.<br> This means that
            enthalpy is the amount of energy in a thermodynamic system (enthalpy is internal energy+(pressure*volume)).
        </p>
        <p>When you measure a heat change at a constant pressure, it is called an <br><strong>enthalpy change</strong>.<br> There are standard condtions necessary to measure enthalpy change these include:
            <ul>
                <li>Pressure of 100 KPa (approximately normal athmospheric pressure)</li>
                <li>Temperature of 298 K (around room temperature)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="para">Measuring heat change at a constant temperature - funny isnt it.<br> But that is not the way to look at it. A reaction can not be said to be over until the temperature of the products is back to room temperature.<br> Look at the illustration below:
            <br>
        </p>
        <div class='reaction-explan'>
            <img class='reaction' src="../images/reaction.jpg" alt="A reaction giving out heat at 298 K" style=" height: 600px;">
            <p> In this exothermic reaction, the reactants are mixed and heat is produced. The heat produced is then given off to the surroundings. In this case, the reaction is not said to be done until the products return to the intitial temperature of
                the reactants.
            </p>

        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">How does temperature affect enthalpy?</h1>
        <p class="para">When the temperature of a system increases, the kinetic and potential energies of the atoms and molecules in the system increase. Thus, the internal energy of the system increases, which means that the enthalpy of the system increases â€“ this is
            true under constant pressure or constant volume.
            <br>In simple terms, If you were to increase the temperature, you would also increase the energy of the molecules, meaning those molecules interact with each other at a greater rate. Thus, you have increased your internal energy. Therefore,
            you would also expect your enthalpy to increase.
            <br>Imagine increasing the temperature of water. At some point, it will turn to steam. At the critical point where the phase change occurs, there will be a decrease in temperature which will lead to a decrease in pressure. (See illustration
            below)
        </p>
        <img class='temp-change' src="https://useruploads.socratic.org/gqSMSW2cSQmUcqS6IaCY_steam_8.gif" alt="Change in state of water">
        <p>This decrease in enthalpy occurs because te steam has lower intermolecular forces holding it together. Hence bonds can be broken with less energy.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">How does pressure affect enthalpy?</h1>
        <p class="para">Pressure affects the amount of heat energy given out by reactions that involve gases. As the temprature increases, so does the enthalpy and vice versa.
            <br> This is because as pressure increases, there is more compression between molecules hence intermolecular forces between molecules increase. Thus, more energy will be needed to break bonds.
            <br>Enthalpy at constant pressure is enthalpy of vaporisation or fusion.
